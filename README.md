## About this project

The idea of the game is to show a minimalist and entertaining way of how to eradicate a disease in a population.

## Why?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, I've dedicated this project to learn the fundamentals of canvas drawing, animation, and user/object interactions.

I'll be more than happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, code structure, and so on!

## Some notes about the project

1. _"Keep it simple"_ was one of the goals that I had in mind while developing.
2. The game was designed using a color palette inspired by an artwork made by [Rudi Hartono](https://dribbble.com/shots/15243102-Game-Match-Recap).
